# Data Scrubbing and Cleaning for Improved Analysis with Python with Python

*A demonstration of data cleaning techniques using Python's Panda libraries with the aim to prepare raw datasets for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.*  

## Objective  

To demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning techniques using Python's Pandas library. The project aims to prepare raw datasets for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.  

## Dataset Selection  

1. Choose a couple of datasets from a reliable source such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or government databases. Ensure they represent different types of data (e.g., tabular, time series, text).
2. Select datasets with noticeable data quality issues like missing values, duplicate entries, inconsistent formats, or outliers.

## Tools  

• Python's Panda library for data manipulation and cleaning

## Key Steps  

1. **Data Collection:** Download the chosen datasets and load them into the Python environment using Pandas.
2. **Initial Data Assessment:**
   
      • Explore the structure of the datasets (columns, data types, size)
   
      • Check for missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers.
   
      • Identify any inconsistencies or errors in data formats.
   
4. **Data Cleaning:**
   
      • Handle missing values: Impute missing values using appropriate methods (mean, median, mode), or drop rows/columns with a high percentage of missing data.
   
      • Remove duplicate entries: Identify and remove duplicate rows if present.
   
      • Standardize data formats: Convert data into consistent formats (e.g., date/time formats, categorical variables).
   
      • Handle outliers: Detect and address outliers using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
   
6. **Data Transformation:**
   
      • Perform data transformations as necessary (e.g., normalization, log transformation).
   
   
      • Create derived features or variables that might enhance analysis.
   
8. **Data Validation:**
   
      • Validate the cleaned datasets to ensure that data quality issues have been addressed effectively.
   
      • Check for any unintended consequences of data cleaning operations.
   
10. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    
      • Document the data cleaning process, including the steps taken and rationale behind decisions.
    
      • Present summary statistics and visualizations to illustrate the improvements in data quality.
    
      • Prepare a report highlighting the impact of data cleaning on the analysis potential of the datasets.
    

## Additional Considerations  
1. Ensure reproducibility by documenting all code and steps taken in the cleaning process.
2. Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.
3. Consider implementing automated data cleaning pipelines for scalability and efficiency.
4. Pay attention to computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Conclusion  

By completing this project, you will showcase your ability to handle real-world data quality issues and prepare datasets for analysis effectively, demonstrating key skills valued in the field of data science.

This project structure adheres to the principles of clear objectives, high-quality data, robust algorithms, interpretability, continuous improvement, cross-functional collaboration, and ethical considerations outlined in the guidelines.
